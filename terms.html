                        Send me an email at lemoncherrypen@gmail.com with a general idea of what you'd like and any reference pictures you'd like to include.
                        You can also message me on Instagram @lemoncherrypen. Feel free to message me with general questions or to ask for a quote as well.

                <button class="accordion">How do you take payment?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        You can pay with Paypal or Venmo. Once we agree on what your commission will look like, I will need at least a partial payment upfront
                        in order to get started. You may either pay 50% upfront and the rest upon completion, or pay full price upfront. Either way, I will send you
                        at least one progress shot for your approval on the design, and a chance to suggest changes once I complete it. When I receive the full payment, I'll send
                        you the fully rendered image. I can make minor changes to the final product up to three times for free. After that, additional changes will cost $3.

                <button class="accordion">What are complex features?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        Examples of complex features are detailed tattoos, props, detailed/multiple accessories, mecha.
                        Complex features will add $1-2 to the base price of a commission.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">What is a complex background?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        Examples of complex backgrounds: cities, forests, bedrooms, basically anything a step up from solid color and simple pattern backgrounds.
                        Prices may vary when backgrounds are densely packed and extremely detailed.

                        Yes, sometimes there are things I won't draw. <br/>
                        &#10004 I <strong>will</strong> draw NSFW, gore, furry characters, and mecha.<br/>

                            <li>NSFW of characters under 18 years old</li>
                            <li>NSFW of characters who are usually depicted as under 18 years old, but are aged up</li>
                            <li>NSFW of celebrities or other real people who could be recognized</li>
                            <li>The action of self harming (this is different than characters who just have scars)</li>
                            <li>Abuse of others, abuse of animals</li>
                            <li>Things that are discriminatory/hateful</li>
                            <li>Situations where consent is violated or unclear</li>
                            <li>Although I accept many kinds of requests, sometimes certain things just make me uncomfortable and I will say no for personal reasons.</li>
                        </ul>
                        If you have a request but are not sure if I will draw it, feel free to send me a message on social media,
                        or email me at lemoncherrypen@gmail.com. Please respect that I have the right to deny any commission request for any reason.

                <button class="accordion">Can I have a printed copy of the commission sent to me?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        These commissions are digital only.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>1-2 weeks.</strong> After we've talked about what you want the commission to look like and I receive at least 50% of the payment upfront, I can begin
                        working on your art (this is when the 1-2 weeks estimate begins). The time it takes will vary depending on the complexity and how much back and forth messaging there is for design
                        changes. I don't offer any "rushed delivery" options for finishing it faster at this time, so please plan on it taking 2 weeks at the most.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Refund Policy</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        There are only two cases where I can issue a refund:
                        <ol>
                            <li>I am unable to finish the work for some reason. In this case, you have the option of either a full refund, or sometimes the option of a reduced price for a picture that ended up smaller/uncolored.</li>
                            <li>You gave me a 100% payment upfront but then changed your mind. In this case, I can only refund 50% because I have already put time into working on it.</li>
                        </ol>
                        If you gave me the non-refundable 50% upfront and then are unable to give me the remaining half, just let me know. I will then stop working on it and just not send you the completed image.
                    </p>
                </div>

            <h3>General Disclaimers</h3>
            <ul class="terms-ul">
                <li>You may not sell the artwork. If you, for example, wanted your design on a shirt, feel free to make one for personal use. But you can't sell the design in any way.</li>
                <li>These are digital commissions. If you would like it printed, I don't offer printing services, but feel free to get it printed somewhere else for personal use.</li>
                <li>I have the right to deny any commission request for any reason.</li>
                <li>I only offer refunds in specific situations. The 50% downpayment is non-refundable unless I can't finish your commission.</li>
                <li>I will not begin working on the commission until I receive at least 50% payment upfront.</li>
                <li>I will not send the completed commission to you until I receive the rest of the payment due.</li>
                <li>You may ask for minor changes to be made to the final product up to three times. After that, each change will cost $3.</li>
