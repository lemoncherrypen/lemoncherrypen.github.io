                        Send me an email at lemoncherrypen@gmail.com with a general idea of what you'd like and any reference pictures you'd like to include.

                <button class="accordion">What are complex features?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        Examples of complex features are detailed tattoos, props, detailed/multiple accessories, mecha.
                        Complex features will add $1-2 to the base price of a commission.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">What is a complex background?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        The price for a complex background will usually be $3 added to the base price of the artwork. Examples of $3 backgrounds: cities, forests, bedrooms, basically anything a step up from solid color and simple pattern backgrounds.
                        Prices may vary when backgrounds are densely packed and extremely detailed, or where a character is not the focus of the artwork.

                    <p>
                        These commissions are digital. If you would like to purchase it as a physical copy, we can discuss an extra charge to help with the
                        cost of supplies, packaging, and shipping.

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        You can pay with Paypal or Venmo. Once we agree on what your commission will look like, I will need at least a partial payment upfront
                        in order to get started. You may either pay 50% upfront and the rest upon completion, or pay full price upfront. Either way, I will send you
                        at least one progress shot for your approval and a chance to suggest changes once I complete it. I can make minor changes to the final product up to three times for free.
                        After that, additional changes will cost $1.
