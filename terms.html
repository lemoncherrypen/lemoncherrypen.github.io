                        Send me an email at lemoncherrypen@gmail.com with a general idea of what you'd like and any reference pictures you'd like to include.
                        You can also message me on Instagram @lemoncherrypen. Feel free to message me with general questions or to ask for a quote.

                <button class="accordion">How do you take payment?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        Paypal or Venmo. Once we agree on what your commission will look like, I will ask for a 50% payment upfront to get started on your project.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">What are complex features?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        Examples of complex features are detailed tattoos, props, detailed/multiple accessories, mecha.
                        Complex features will add $1-2 to the base price of a commission.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">What is a complex background?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        Examples of complex backgrounds: cities, forests, bedrooms, basically anything a step up from solid color and simple pattern backgrounds.
                        Prices may vary when backgrounds are densely packed and extremely detailed.

                <button class="accordion">Are there things you won't draw?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        Yeah there are some requests I don't accept for commissions. There are plenty of things I'm open to drawing, 
                        such as human characters, furries, armor, fantasy species, and certain types of mature content. I will not draw things
                        for commercial use, and I have restrictions on mature content. For example, one of my rules is that any character
                        depicted in NSFW art must be an adult and may not be an aged-up version of a minor. There is no guaruntee that I will accept
                        a request, because sometimes I'm just not comfortable drawing something.<br/>
                        
                        
                        If you have a request but are not sure if I will draw it, feel free to send me a message on social media,
                        or email me at lemoncherrypen@gmail.com. Please respect that I have the right to deny any commission request for any reason.

                <button class="accordion">Can I have a printed copy of the commission sent to me?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        These commissions are digital only.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">How long does a commission take?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        <strong>About 1-2 weeks.</strong> Time to complete the project will depend on its complexity. I will only begin working on it after I've received the initial 50% payment.
                        I'll keep you in the loop with how your project is going by sending you progress pictures for your approval.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Refund Policy</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        There are only two cases where I can issue a refund:
                        <ol>
                            <li>I am unable to finish the work for some reason. In this case, you have the option of either a full refund, or sometimes the option of a reduced price for a picture that ended up smaller/uncolored.</li>
                            <li>You gave me a 100% payment upfront but then changed your mind about wanting the commission. In this case, I can only refund 50% because I have already put time into working on it.</li>
                        </ol>
                        If you gave me the non-refundable 50% upfront and then are unable to give me the remaining half, just let me know. In this case, we can cancel the commission or see if another payment plan would work better.
                    </p>
